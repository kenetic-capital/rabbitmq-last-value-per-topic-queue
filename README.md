# Installation instructions

Easiest thing to do is to:
- make run-broker from above, check that you see "started with 1 plugins", then stop the process
- copy plugins/rabbit_topic_last_value_queue-[version].ez in to the plugins directory for your installation (usually /usr/lib/rabbitmq/plugins/)
- you should now see the plugin when you do rabbitmq-plugins list and can enable/disable it using that tool

If you need any more info in installing plugins and/or troubleshooting then refer to:
